- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### **What to Expect**
1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll evaluate the severity and impact

5. **Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure after fix is deployed
6. **Recognition**: Security researchers will be credited (if desired)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### **Smart Contract Security**
- All contracts use OpenZeppelin battle-tested implementations
- Comprehensive test coverage with edge case testing
- Access control with role-based permissions
- Reentrancy protection on all state-changing functions
- Input validation and bounds checking
- Emergency pause mechanisms where appropriate

### **Treasury Protection**
- Immutable constants for release schedules
- Time-locked operations with transparent cooldowns
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Emergency limits with yearly cooldown periods
- Real-time monitoring of treasury operations

### **Frontend Security**
- Never store private keys in browser storage
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure wallet connection practices
- HTTPS-only communications
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## 🔍 Audit Status

### **Current Status**
- **Internal Review**: ✅ Completed
- **Community Review**: ✅ Ongoing (testnet)
- **Professional Audit**: 🟡 Planned for v5.2
- **Bug Bounty**: 🟡 Planned for mainnet launch

### **Previous Audits**
- None yet - this is the first major release
- Planning professional audit before mainnet deployment

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### **Testnet Limitations**
- Testnet tokens have no real value
- Network congestion may cause delays
- Some features are for testing purposes only

### **Acknowledged Risks**
- Smart contract upgrades use proxy patterns (mitigated with timelock)
- Oracle dependencies for external price feeds (mitigated with fallbacks)
- Network congestion can affect user experience

## 🔧 Security Features

### **Access Controls**
- Role-based permission system
- Multi-signature requirements for critical functions
- Timelock mechanisms for sensitive operations

### **Economic Security**
- Deflationary token mechanics prevent infinite supply
- Rug-proof treasury with immutable release schedules
- Emergency limits with yearly cooldowns

### **Anti-Cheat Mechanisms**
- 30-second solve delay to prevent instant solutions
- Sybil resistance through reputation tokens
- Cross-contract validation of solve attempts
