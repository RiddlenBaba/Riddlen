git commit -m "feat: v6.0 major update - Three-Phase Airdrop with Validation Earning

Summary:
Complete overhaul of airdrop system integrating Oracle Network validation
as a third earning mechanism. Maintains 100M RDLN total allocation while
enabling users to earn through social proof, RON reputation, and active
validation work.

- Phase 1 (Social): 33M RDLN, 5K per wallet (6,600 max)
- Phase 2 (RON Tiers): 33M RDLN, 2K-5K based on RON holdings
- Phase 3 (Validation): 34M RDLN, 500 per validation, 5K max per wallet
- Global limit: 15,000 RDLN per wallet across all phases
- All three phases can run simultaneously

Implementation:
- Oracle Network integration (getValidatorProfile interface)
- Multiple claim mechanism for Phase 3
- 25% bonus for 10+ validations
- 1,000 RON minimum for Phase 3 eligibility
- Helper functions: getTotalClaimed(), getRemainingClaimable()

Testing:
- 20/20 tests passing
- Full ecosystem integration test
- MockOracleNetwork for testing
- Comprehensive Phase 3 coverage

Documentation:
- USER_JOURNEY_AIRDROP.md: Step-by-step guide with Alice example
- SECURITY_AUDIT_RiddlenAirdrop_v6.md: Production-ready audit
- DEVLOG_AIRDROP_V6.md: Technical implementation details
- GIT_COMMIT_NOTES.md: Commit strategy and notes

Security:
✅ Zero critical vulnerabilities
✅ ReentrancyGuard on all claims
✅ CEI pattern implementation
✅ Access control with 5 roles
✅ Pausable emergency mechanism
✅ UUPS upgradeable pattern

Status: ✅ Production-ready, awaiting deployment

## 📌 Important Notes

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ **Constructor signature changed** - requires Oracle Network address
⚠️ **Phase 1 rewards reduced** - 50K → 5K per wallet
⚠️ **Phase 2 tiers adjusted** - new tier structure (2K-5K)

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing Phase 1/2 functions maintain same interface
- ✅ RDLN and RON token interfaces unchanged
- ✅ Existing view functions work as before
- ⚠️ New deployments require Oracle Network address

### Migration Path
If upgrading from v5.x:
1. Deploy Oracle Network contract
2. Deploy new RiddlenAirdrop proxy with Oracle address
3. Transfer RDLN allocation to new contract
4. Deactivate old contract phases
5. Migrate user data (if needed)
6. Activate new contract phases

---

## 🎓 Lessons for Future Development

1. **User Feedback Critical:** "All phases run simultaneously" clarification changed architecture
2. **RON Requirements:** "Few thousand RON" → specific 1,000 minimum requirement
3. **Testing Permissions:** OpenZeppelin upgrades directory needs proper permissions
4. **Mock Contracts:** Different interface than production (setBalance vs transfer)
5. **Time Advances:** Oracle cooldowns require `evm_increaseTime` in tests
