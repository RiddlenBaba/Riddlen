# üåê Riddlen Oracle Network - Architecture

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Purpose**: External data validation network for enterprises
**Status**: üîß **IN DESIGN**

---

## Executive Summary

The **Riddlen Oracle Network** is a **decentralized data validation service** that allows external companies to leverage Riddlen's community of high-reputation users to verify information.

**Key Difference from Game System**:
- ‚ùå **NOT** for game riddles (that's RiddleSubmissionManager)
- ‚úÖ **FOR** enterprise data validation
- ‚úÖ Dynamic pricing (companies set rewards)
- ‚úÖ Revenue generation (Riddlen takes fees)
- ‚úÖ Brings external value into ecosystem

---

## üéØ Core Concept

### Traditional Oracle Problem
Companies need trusted off-chain data verified, but:
- Centralized oracles = single point of failure
- Expensive oracle services (Chainlink, API3)
- Lack of domain expertise

### Riddlen Solution
**Leverage your high-RON reputation holders as validators**

```
Company: "Verify this data is correct"
    ‚Üì
Riddlen Network: "Our validators will verify it"
    ‚Üì
Validators: Stake RON, submit answers
    ‚Üì
Consensus: Majority wins (e.g., 5 of 7)
    ‚Üì
Reward: RDLN distributed to correct validators
    ‚Üì
Riddlen: Takes 10% protocol fee
```

---

## üè¢ Use Cases

### 1. Financial Data Verification
**Example**: "What was BTC/USD price at timestamp X?"
- Companies pay 1000 RDLN reward
- Validators check multiple sources
- Consensus reached
- Correct validators split reward

### 2. Event Verification
**Example**: "Did this transaction occur on Ethereum?"
- Companies pay 500 RDLN reward
- Validators check blockchain
- 5 of 7 agree "Yes"
- Reward distributed

### 3. Content Moderation
**Example**: "Does this image violate terms of service?"
- Platform pays 200 RDLN reward
- Validators review content
- Majority consensus
- Human judgment at scale

### 4. Research Validation
**Example**: "Is this scientific claim accurate?"
- Research firm pays 5000 RDLN reward
- High-RON validators (experts) review
- Consensus on accuracy
- Quality assurance

### 5. Supply Chain Verification
**Example**: "Did shipment arrive at location X?"
- Logistics company pays 300 RDLN reward
- Local validators verify
- Photo proof submitted
- Real-world validation

## üí∞ Economic Model

### For Companies (Requesters)

```solidity
Create Request:
    - Set reward pool (e.g., 1000 RDLN)
    - Set required validators (e.g., 7)
    - Set consensus threshold (e.g., 5 of 7 = 71%)
    - Set deadline (e.g., 24 hours)
    - Pay upfront (1000 RDLN + 10% fee = 1100 RDLN)

If Consensus Reached:
    - Correct validators split reward
    - Incorrect validators lose stake
    - Company gets verified answer

If No Consensus:
    - Reward refunded (minus small fee)
    - Request can be reposted with higher reward
```

### For Validators (Users)

```solidity
Requirements:
    - Minimum RON balance (e.g., 1000 RON)
    - Good reputation score (>80%)
    - Stake RON tokens (slashed if wrong)

Process:
    1. Browse available requests
    2. Stake RON (e.g., 100 RON)
    3. Submit answer with proof
    4. Wait for consensus
    5. If correct: Earn RDLN + RON returned
    6. If incorrect: Lose staked RON

Earnings:
    - Share of RDLN reward pool
    - Build reputation score
    - Access to higher-paying requests
```

### For Riddlen (Protocol)

```solidity
Revenue Streams:
    1. Protocol fee (10% of reward pool)
    2. Slashed stakes from incorrect validators
    3. Premium validator badges (optional)
    4. Enterprise API access (optional)

Distribution:
    - 50% to treasury
    - 30% to RDLN buyback & burn
    - 20% to top validators (monthly bonus)
```

## üîê Validator System

### Reputation Requirements

| Tier | Min RON | Min Accuracy | Max Stake | Access |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Bronze** | 100 RON | None | 10 RON | Low-paying requests |
| **Silver** | 1,000 RON | 70% | 100 RON | Medium requests |
| **Gold** | 10,000 RON | 85% | 1,000 RON | High-paying requests |
| **Platinum** | 100,000 RON | 95% | 10,000 RON | Premium enterprise |

### Staking Mechanism

```solidity
Validator Stakes RON:
    - Locked during validation period
    - Returned if correct
    - Slashed if incorrect (50% burned, 50% to correct validators)
    - Higher stake = higher reward share (weighted distribution)
```

### Reputation Score

```solidity
Calculation:
    - Correct validations: +10 points
    - Incorrect validations: -20 points
    - Consensus participation: +5 points
    - Quick response: +2 points

Accuracy = (Correct Validations / Total Validations) * 100

Effects:
    - <70%: Temporary suspension
    - 70-85%: Normal access
    - 85-95%: Premium access
    - >95%: Elite validator status
```

## üîÑ Request Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Request Creation
```solidity
Company calls: createValidationRequest(
    dataHash,           // Hash of data to validate
    question,           // Human-readable question
    requiredValidators, // e.g., 7
    consensusThreshold, // e.g., 5 (71%)
    rewardPool,         // e.g., 1000 RDLN
    deadline,           // e.g., 24 hours
    category            // e.g., "Price Data", "Event", "Content"
)

Cost: rewardPool * 1.10 (10% protocol fee)
Status: Open
```

### Phase 2: Validation Period
```solidity
Validators:
    1. Browse open requests
    2. Stake RON tokens
    3. Submit answer: submitValidation(requestId, answer, proof)
    4. Wait for others

Constraints:
    - Must meet tier requirements
    - Can only submit once
    - Cannot change answer
    - Stake locked until finalization
```

### Phase 3: Consensus Determination
```solidity
Automatic when:
    - Threshold reached (e.g., 5 of 7 validators submitted)
    - OR deadline passed

Process:
    1. Count submissions per answer
    2. Determine majority (e.g., 5 validators said "True")
    3. If ‚â• threshold: Consensus reached
    4. If < threshold: No consensus
```

### Phase 4: Reward Distribution
```solidity
If Consensus Reached:
    correctValidators = validators who matched majority

    For each correct validator:
        rewardShare = (theirStake / totalCorrectStake) * rewardPool
        transfer(validator, rewardShare)
        returnStake(validator)
        updateReputation(validator, +10)

    For each incorrect validator:
        slashAmount = theirStake * 0.5
        burn(slashAmount)
        distribute(slashAmount, correctValidators) // bonus
        updateReputation(validator, -20)

If No Consensus:
    refund(requester, rewardPool * 0.95) // 5% no-consensus fee
    returnAllStakes()
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Mechanisms

### 1. Sybil Attack Prevention
- Require minimum RON balance (reputation tied to single identity)
- Higher rewards require higher tier (more RON)
- Stake required (economic cost to attack)

### 2. Collusion Prevention
- Validators don't know who else is validating
- Cannot change answer once submitted
- Random selection for high-value requests
- Time delays between submissions

### 3. Data Privacy
- Sensitive data hashed on-chain
- Full data shared off-chain to validators
- Zero-knowledge proofs (future enhancement)
- Encrypted channels for communication

### 4. Validator Honesty
- Reputation scoring (persistent identity)
- Economic stake at risk
- Slashing for incorrect answers
- Long-term earning potential > short-term gain

### 5. Request Spam Prevention
- Minimum reward amounts
- Requester reputation tracking
- Rate limiting per address
- Deposit requirements

## üöÄ Revenue Potential

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: 100 requests/day @ 500 RDLN average**
```
Daily volume: 100 * 500 = 50,000 RDLN
Protocol fee (10%): 5,000 RDLN/day
Monthly: 150,000 RDLN
Yearly: 1,825,000 RDLN

At $0.10/RDLN: $182,500/year
At $1.00/RDLN: $1,825,000/year
```

**Scenario 2: Enterprise adoption (10 companies, 10 requests/day each)**
```
Daily volume: 100 * 1,000 = 100,000 RDLN
Protocol fee: 10,000 RDLN/day
Yearly: 3,650,000 RDLN

At $1.00/RDLN: $3,650,000/year
```

**Scenario 3: High-value requests (1 request/day @ 10,000 RDLN)**
```
Daily: 1 * 10,000 = 10,000 RDLN
Protocol fee: 1,000 RDLN/day
Yearly: 365,000 RDLN

At $1.00/RDLN: $365,000/year
```
