# üèõÔ∏è Riddlen DAO System - Complete Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DAO CONTRACT COMPLETE**

---

## üéØ What Was Built

### RiddlenDAO.sol ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Location**: `contracts/governance/RiddlenDAO.sol`
**Compiler**: Solidity 0.8.24
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPILED SUCCESSFULLY**

**Key Features Implemented**:

1. **Founder Role System** ‚úÖ
   - `founder` address with executive powers
   - `founderRoleActive` boolean flag
   - Transfer role to another address
   - Transfer role to DAO itself
   - Dissolve role permanently (after 1 year)
   - Cannot be undone once dissolved

2. **Era-Based Economics** ‚úÖ
   - Proposal threshold follows 730-day halving
   - Era 0: 10,000 RON required
   - Era 1: 5,000 RON required
   - Era 2: 2,500 RON required
   - Continues halving every 2 years

3. **Progressive Quorum** ‚úÖ
   - Starts at 5% of total RON supply
   - Increases 1% per era
   - Caps at 15% maximum
   - Ensures growing participation over time

4. **Founder Powers** ‚úÖ
   - `executeAsFounder()` - instant execution without vote
   - `vetoProposal()` - veto passed proposals with public reason
   - `executeAdvisoryProposal()` - execute community proposals
   - All actions emit transparent events

5. **Three-Phase Governance** ‚úÖ
   - **Phase 1**: Founder has full control, can execute instantly
   - **Phase 2**: Community proposes, founder can veto
   - **Phase 3**: Founder role transferred/dissolved, full DAO control

6. **OpenZeppelin Governor Integration** ‚úÖ
   - GovernorUpgradeable base
   - GovernorSettings (voting delay, period, threshold)
   - GovernorCountingSimple (yes/no/abstain voting)
   - GovernorVotes (snapshot-based voting)
   - GovernorVotesQuorumFraction (flexible quorum)
   - GovernorTimelockControl (48-hour delay)
   - AccessControl (role-based permissions)
   - UUPS Upgradeability

## üîß Integration Requirements

### 1. RON Token Upgrade Needed

**Current State**:
- RONAdvanced.sol deployed at `0xD86b146Ed091b59cE050B9d40f8e2760f14Ab635`
- Has internal governance system
- Does NOT have ERC20Votes

**What's Needed**:
- Add `ERC20VotesUpgradeable` to RONAdvanced
- Implement `getPastVotes(address, uint256)` for snapshots
- Implement checkpoint system for vote tracking
- Optional: Add delegation support

**Why**:
- RiddlenDAO uses `GovernorVotesUpgradeable`
- Requires `IVotes` interface (from ERC20Votes)
- Enables snapshot-based voting (prevents vote manipulation)

**Solution Options**:

#### Option A: Upgrade RONAdvanced (Recommended)
```solidity
// Add to RONAdvanced inheritance:
contract RONAdvanced is
    // ... existing
    ERC20VotesUpgradeable  // ADD THIS
{
    // Voting power = RON balance (soul-bound)
    // No transfers allowed (existing soul-bound logic)
    // Delegation optional (can delegate voting power)
}
```

#### Option B: Create Voting Wrapper
```solidity
// Separate contract that wraps RON for voting
contract RONVotingWrapper is ERC20VotesUpgradeable {
    IRON public ronToken;

    function getVotes(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return ronToken.balanceOf(account);
    }
}
```

#### Option C: Modify RiddlenDAO
```solidity
// Remove GovernorVotesUpgradeable, use custom voting
function getVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber) public view override returns (uint256) {
    // Call RON balanceOf directly
    return ronToken.balanceOf(account);
}
```

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Upgrade RONAdvanced
- Most standard approach
- Best compatibility with Governor pattern
- Enables future DAO integrations
- Allows delegation if desired

---

### 2. TimelockController Deployment

**What's Needed**:
- Deploy OpenZeppelin's `TimelockControllerUpgradeable`
- Set 48-hour delay (172800 seconds)
- Grant PROPOSER_ROLE to RiddlenDAO
- Grant EXECUTOR_ROLE to RiddlenDAO
- Grant ADMIN_ROLE to founder initially

**Why**:
- Provides 48-hour window to review proposals
- Allows community to react to bad proposals
- Standard governance best practice
- Required by GovernorTimelockControl

**Code**:
```solidity
// Deploy TimelockControllerUpgradeable
TimelockControllerUpgradeable timelock = new TimelockControllerUpgradeable();

address[] memory proposers = [address(dao)];
address[] memory executors = [address(dao)];
address admin = founderAddress;

timelock.initialize(
    172800, // 48-hour delay
    proposers,
    executors,
    admin
);
```

### 3. Deployment Order

1. ‚úÖ **RDLN Token** - Already deployed
2. ‚úÖ **RON Token** - Already deployed (needs upgrade)
3. ‚è≥ **Upgrade RON** - Add ERC20Votes
4. ‚è≥ **Deploy Timelock** - 48-hour delay
5. ‚è≥ **Deploy RiddlenDAO** - With founder role
6. ‚è≥ **Grant Roles** - DAO gets timelock proposer/executor

## üìä DAO Features Summary

### Voting Power
- **1 RON = 1 Vote** (proportional)
- **Soul-Bound** (no transfers, can't buy votes)
- **Earned Only** (through solving riddles, validating, curating)
- **Snapshot-Based** (prevents vote manipulation)

### Proposal Creation
- **Era 0**: Requires 10,000 RON
- **Era 1**: Requires 5,000 RON (after 2 years)
- **Era 2**: Requires 2,500 RON (after 4 years)
- Decreases over time to expand participation

### Voting Period
- **1 Day Voting Delay** (7,200 blocks @ 12s)
- **1 Week Voting Period** (50,400 blocks)
- **48-Hour Timelock** (after passing)
- Total: ~9 days from proposal to execution

### Quorum
- **Era 0**: 5% of total RON supply
- **Era 1**: 6% of total RON supply
- **Era 2**: 7% of total RON supply
- **Maximum**: 15% cap
- Increases gradually to ensure active participation

### Founder Powers
- **Phase 1** (Launch): Execute instantly, veto, advisory execution
- **Phase 2** (Mature): Transfer to DAO or trusted person
- **Phase 3** (Decentralized): Dissolve permanently (after 1 year minimum)

- ‚úÖ Gradual handoff (founder can listen to community)
- ‚úÖ Complete decentralization (transfer to DAO or dissolve)
- ‚úÖ Era-based economics (decreasing barriers over time)
- ‚úÖ Proportional voting (1 RON = 1 vote, earned only)
