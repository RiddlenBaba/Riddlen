Cross-market innovation creating new category

1. NFT Architecture & Mechanics
1.1 Core NFT Design
Unique NFT-as-Game Concept:
Traditional NFT: Static image/metadata → Collectible value only
Riddlen NFT: Interactive game session → Functional utility + collectible value

NFT Components:
├── Game Access Token (entry to riddle session)
├── Prize Distribution Mechanism (randomized reward pools)
├── Achievement Certificate (proof of successful solving)
└── Collectible Asset (secondary market trading)

Smart Contract Architecture:
contract RiddleNFT {
    struct RiddleSession {
        uint256 maxMints;          // 10-1,000 copies available
        uint256 prizePool;         // 100K-10M RDLN total rewards
        uint256 winnerSlots;       // 1-100 potential winners
        uint256 difficulty;        // Progressive scaling factor
        string[] questionHashes;   // Encrypted question references
        uint256 timeLimit;         // Session duration constraints
        bool isActive;             // Current session status
        mapping(address => bool) winners; // Successful solvers
    }
}
