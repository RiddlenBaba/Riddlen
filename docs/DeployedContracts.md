```solidity
// Roles
MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE")
TRANSFER_ROLE = keccak256("TRANSFER_ROLE")

// Platform Fees
DEFAULT_FEE_RECIPIENT = 0x1Af20C6B23373350aD464700B5965CE4B0D2aD94
DEFAULT_FEE_BPS = 100 (1%)
MAX_BPS = 10,000

// Key Functions
- mintTo(address to, uint256 amount)
- mintWithSignature(MintRequest req, bytes signature)
- burn(uint256 amount) / burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)
- setPrimarySaleRecipient(address recipient)
- setPlatformFeeInfo(address recipient, uint256 feeBps)
```

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: New RDLN Contract
Create a new, clean RDLN contract specifically designed for Riddlen with:
1. All whitepaper tokenomics (1B supply, allocations)
2. Progressive burn mechanics
3. Game integration functions
4. Proper access controls for game contracts

### Phase 2: Migration Strategy
- Deploy new contract alongside existing one
- Create migration tools for existing holders
- Coordinate community migration
- Maintain both contracts during transition period

### Phase 3: Integration
- Connect new RDLN to RON reputation system
- Integrate with riddle NFT contracts
- Connect to prize pool management
- Enable full ecosystem functionality

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Document current state (this file)
2. üîÑ Design new RDLN contract with Riddlen features
3. ‚è≥ Create RON reputation system
4. ‚è≥ Build riddle NFT contract
5. ‚è≥ Develop prize pool management
6. ‚è≥ Create migration tools
