# Protocol Guides

Comprehensive guides covering the core mechanics, economics, and development history of Riddlen Protocol. These documents explain how the protocol creates a merit-based ecosystem where intelligence drives value.

---

## Economic Guides

### [Tokenomics](tokenomics.html)
**The dual-token economy of Riddlen Protocol**

Understanding the complete token economics system that powers the Riddlen ecosystem. This guide covers:

- **RDLN Token**: Primary utility token with deflationary mechanics
- **RON Token**: Soul-bound reputation tokens for access control
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion RDLN distribution breakdown
- **Allocation Strategy**: Prize pools, treasury, airdrop, and liquidity
- **Deflationary Mechanics**: How burning creates economic pressure
- **Merit-Based Access**: RON-gated tiers and oracle network validation

Learn how the two-token system separates financial incentives (RDLN) from intellectual reputation (RON) to create sustainable economics.

**Topics**: Token distribution, allocation management, deflationary economics, dual-token mechanics

---

### [Burning Protocol](burning-protocol.html)
**Deflationary mechanics and Proof-of-Solve economics**

Deep dive into Riddlen's sophisticated burning mechanisms that create economic pressure while maintaining ecosystem sustainability. Key concepts include:

- **Proof-of-Solve Philosophy**: Intelligence is the scarce resource
- **Progressive Burn Costs**: Increasing costs discourage spam
- **Attempt-Based Burning**: Failed attempts have escalating penalties
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Economic incentives for thoughtful participation
- **Burn Tracking**: Transparent on-chain burn monitoring
- **Supply Reduction**: How burning drives long-term value

Unlike simple burn-on-transfer models, Riddlen implements activity-based burns tied to user performance and behavior.

**Topics**: Deflationary economics, progressive costs, spam prevention, burn mechanics

## Gameplay Guides

### [NFT Mechanics](nft-mechanics.html)
**Weekly riddle system and NFT-as-game protocol**

Complete guide to the Riddlen weekly riddle release system where NFTs represent solve attempts with substantial RDLN prizes. Features include:

- **20-Year Schedule**: 1,000 riddles from 2025-2045
- **Weekly Releases**: Exactly 1 riddle per week
- **NFT Solve Attempts**: Each mint is a solve attempt
- **Progressive Costs**: Burn costs increase with attempts
- **Prize Pools**: Substantial RDLN rewards for solvers
- **Tiered Rewards**: First solvers earn significantly more
- **RON Reputation**: Earn non-transferable reputation tokens

Learn how Riddlen transforms NFTs from static collectibles into interactive gaming experiences.

**Topics**: Weekly riddles, NFT gaming, prize distribution, solve mechanics, tiered rewards

## Development Documentation

### [Development Log](DEVELOPMENT-LOG.html)
**Complete development history and implementation notes**

Comprehensive chronological record of Riddlen Protocol's development from initial conception through current v6.0 deployment. This log documents:

- **Phase 1: Foundation** - RDLN token and core infrastructure
- **Phase 2: Reputation** - RON soul-bound token system
- **Phase 3: Gaming** - NFT riddle mechanics and tiered rewards
- **Phase 4: Treasury** - Automated treasury drip systems
- **Phase 5: Groups** - Social mechanics and group play
- **Phase 6: Ecosystem** - Oracle network, DAO, and Farcaster Frames

Each phase includes completed tasks, technical decisions, challenges overcome, and lessons learned during implementation.

**Topics**: Development history, technical decisions, implementation notes, version timeline
