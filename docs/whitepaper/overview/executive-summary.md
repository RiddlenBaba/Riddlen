Riddlen introduces **Proof-of-Solve**, the first blockchain consensus mechanism that rewards human intelligence over computational power or capital stakes. Through NFT-based riddle sessions with randomized parameters, Riddlen creates a sustainable, deflationary economy where intellectual contribution becomes the primary value creation mechanism.

## Revolutionary Economics

Unlike traditional play-to-earn models that suffer from inflationary collapse, Riddlen implements a pre-allocated prize distribution system with deflationary burn mechanisms. The 700M RDLN prize pool rewards solvers while 20M+ RDLN gets permanently burned through gameplay, creating sustainable token scarcity.

## Dual-Token Innovation

RDLN serves as the economic engine while RON (Riddlen Oracle Network tokens) represent non-transferable reputation earned through validated problem-solving ability. This separation prevents wealthy players from buying their way to validation privileges.

## Long-term Vision

The gaming platform evolves into RON—a human-powered oracle network where enterprises pay for validated human intelligence on complex, subjective, or contextual decisions that AI cannot reliably make.

## Market Opportunity

The global consulting market exceeds $150 billion annually while blockchain oracle services represent a rapidly growing sector. Riddlen bridges these markets by creating scalable infrastructure for decentralized human validation.
