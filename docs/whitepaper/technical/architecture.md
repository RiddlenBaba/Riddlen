# Technical Architecture

## 5.1 Smart Contract Infrastructure (Polygon)

### Core Protocol Stack

**RDLN Token Contract:**
```solidity
- ERC-20 with integrated burn functionality
- Deflationary mechanics on every transaction
- Multi-signature treasury management
- Cross-chain bridge compatibility
```

**RON Reputation System:**
```solidity
- Soul-bound tokens representing earned intelligence
- Difficulty-weighted scoring algorithms
- Historical accuracy tracking and validation
- Oracle access tier management and permissions
```

**Riddle Management Engine:**
```solidity
- Question submission with progressive cost calculation
- Multi-validator approval workflows with reputation weighting
- Cryptographic answer hash generation and verification
- Creator royalty distribution and ongoing rewards
```

**NFT Generation System:**
```solidity
- Randomized parameter assignment (mint rate, prize pool, winners)
- Dynamic difficulty balancing based on historical solve rates
- Metadata embedding with question references and prize allocation
- Secondary market integration with royalty enforcement
```

**Oracle Network Interface:**
```solidity
- Corporate query submission and payment processing
- RON-based validator selection and assignment algorithms
- Consensus mechanisms for subjective human responses
- Dispute resolution and accuracy tracking systems
```

## 5.2 Security Framework

### Multi-Signature Treasury Architecture
- **Treasury Operations:** 3-of-5 signature requirement
- **Prize Pool Management:** 3-of-5 signature requirement
- **Grand Prize Vault:** 4-of-5 signature requirement (legendary events)
- **Development Operations:** 2-of-3 signature requirement

### Smart Contract Security
- Pre-deployment audits by established security firms
- Formal verification of economic and consensus mechanisms
- Ongoing bug bounty programs with community participation
- Gradual fund deployment minimizing catastrophic risk exposure
