# Solution: Riddlen's Proof-of-Solve Protocol

## 2.1 Core Innovation Framework

### Proof-of-Solve Consensus
- First blockchain protocol validating human intelligence through cryptographic puzzles
- Progressive difficulty scaling ensuring accessibility while rewarding expertise
- Community-driven content creation with peer validation systems

### Dual-Token Architecture

```
RDLN (Economic Layer)
├── Deflationary store of value
├── Prize pools and transaction fees
├── Governance and ecosystem funding
└── Burns create permanent scarcity

RON (Reputation Layer)
├── Non-transferable intelligence validation
├── Earned through proven problem-solving
├── Gates access to oracle validation tiers
└── Cannot be purchased, only earned
```

### Self-Sustaining Content Engine
- Users submit questions with progressive RDLN stakes
- Multi-validator peer review networks ensure quality
- Algorithmic assembly creates balanced riddle experiences
- Creator royalties incentivize ongoing contribution

## 2.2 Riddle NFT Mechanics

Each riddle exists as a unique NFT with three randomized parameters:

- **Max Mint Rate:** 10-1,000 copies available per riddle
- **Prize Pool:** 100,000-10,000,000 RDLN per riddle (averaging 700,000)
- **Winner Slots:** 1-100 potential winners per riddle

### Example Configurations

**Accessible Riddle:**
- 500 NFT copies available
- 2,000,000 RDLN prize pool
- 50 winner slots
- 40,000 RDLN per winner

**Elite Challenge:**
- 25 NFT copies available
- 5,000,000 RDLN prize pool
- 5 winner slots
- 1,000,000 RDLN per winner

**Legendary Mystery:**
- 10 NFT copies available
- 10,000,000 RDLN prize pool
- 1 winner slot
- 10,000,000 RDLN winner-takes-all

## 2.3 Progressive Economics Design

### NFT Minting Costs (Biennial Halving)

```
Years 1-2:  1,000 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 3-4:    500 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 5-6:    250 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 7-8:    125 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 9-10:    62 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 11-12:   31 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 13-14:   15 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 15-16:    7 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 17-18:    3 RDLN per riddle attempt
Years 19-20:  1.5 RDLN per riddle attempt (final minimum)
```

### Attempt Burn Protocol

```
1st failed attempt: 1 RDLN burned
2nd failed attempt: 2 RDLN burned
3rd failed attempt: 3 RDLN burned
Nth failed attempt: N RDLN burned
```

### Question Submission Costs

```
1st question per wallet: 1 RDLN
2nd question per wallet: 2 RDLN
Nth question per wallet: N RDLN
```
