## Key Differences from Other Versions

### v5.1 vs v5.2
- **v5.1:** NO transaction split on mints/solves
- **v5.2:** 25% burn / 25% grand prize / 25% treasury / 25% artists
- **Current Site:** Shows 50% burn / 25% grand prize / 25% treasury (INCORRECT)

### What Needs to be Fixed
1. Remove all references to 50%/25%/25% split on minting/solving
2. Explain that minting fees accumulate (not burned immediately)
3. Only failed attempts burn progressively
4. Grand Prize comes from 700M pre-allocated prize pool
5. Treasury is 100M pre-allocated (not from transaction splits)
