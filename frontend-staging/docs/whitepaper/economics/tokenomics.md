## 3.2 20-Year Economic Projections

### Revenue Generation Analysis

**NFT Minting Revenue (20 years):**
- Years 1-2: 10.0M RDLN (1,000 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 3-4: 5.0M RDLN (500 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 5-6: 2.5M RDLN (250 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 7-8: 1.25M RDLN (125 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 9-10: 620K RDLN (62 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 11-12: 310K RDLN (31 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 13-14: 150K RDLN (15 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 15-16: 70K RDLN (7 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 17-18: 30K RDLN (3 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- Years 19-20: 15K RDLN (1.5 RDLN × 10,000 mints)
- **Total: 19.97M RDLN**

**Burn Protocol Revenue:**
- Failed attempts: ~600K RDLN permanently burned
- Question rejections: ~50K RDLN permanently burned
- **Total: 650K RDLN permanently removed from circulation**

**Deflationary Impact:**
- Total tokens burned: 20.62M RDLN
- Effective supply reduction: ~2.06%
- Creates sustained scarcity pressure supporting long-term value appreciation over full 19.2-year cycle

## 3.3 Economic Flow Design

The system creates a beautiful economic cycle:

```
Token Distribution (Value Creation)
├── 700M RDLN → Prize pools create circulation and utility
├── 100M RDLN → Treasury supports ecosystem development
├── 100M RDLN → Airdrops drive adoption and community growth
└── 100M RDLN → Liquidity enables trading and price discovery

Token Collection (Deflationary Pressure)
├── 19.97M RDLN → NFT minting fees (can be burned)
├── 650K RDLN → Failed attempts and rejections (permanently burned)
└── Biennial halving → Creates predictable scarcity over 19.2-year cycle
```

**Key Insight:** Prize pools distribute pre-allocated tokens while gameplay burns additional tokens, creating net deflationary pressure over time.
