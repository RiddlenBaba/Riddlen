## 🧠 What is Riddlen?

Riddlen introduces **Proof-of-Solve**, a revolutionary consensus mechanism that validates human intelligence through NFT-based riddle sessions. Our dual-token system (RDLN + RON) creates sustainable economics while building toward a human-powered oracle network for enterprise validation needs.

### Key Innovation
- **RDLN Token:** Deflationary economic engine with pre-allocated prize pools
- **RON Reputation:** Non-transferable intelligence validation earned through problem-solving
- **Oracle Evolution:** Gaming platform transforms into enterprise human validation infrastructure

## 📊 Protocol Overview

| Specification | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Network** | Polygon (MATIC) |
| **Total Supply** | 1,000,000,000 RDLN |
| **Prize Pool** | 700M RDLN (70% of supply) |
| **Release Schedule** | 1,000 riddles over 20 years |
| **Consensus** | Proof-of-Solve + Oracle Network |
| **Current Version** | v5.1.0 |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Players
1. Visit [riddlen.com](https://riddlen.com) to access the platform
2. Connect wallet to Riddlen platform
3. Purchase riddle NFTs with RDLN tokens
4. Solve puzzles to earn prizes and RON reputation
5. Progress through difficulty tiers for oracle access

### For Developers
```bash
# Clone the main repository
git clone https://github.com/RiddlenBaba/Riddlen.git
