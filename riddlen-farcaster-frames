Date: September 30, 2025
Focus: Frames.js implementation for Farcaster miniapp deployment

Executive Summary
This report provides comprehensive due diligence for integrating Riddlen's NFT riddle platform with Farcaster using frames.js. Based on current market conditions and technical capabilities as of September 2025, Farcaster Frames represent a strategic growth channel for Riddlen's user acquisition.

Key Findings:

‚úÖ Farcaster has 710,000 users with 500,000 daily casts (strong TAM)
‚úÖ Frames.js is production-ready with robust debugging tools
‚úÖ Crypto-native audience reduces onboarding friction
‚ö†Ô∏è Frames v2 (Mini Apps) launched early 2025 - newer standard to consider
‚ö†Ô∏è Daily active users declined 28% in past 6 months - platform maturing
Recommendation: Proceed with Frames.js implementation using hybrid approach (Frames v1 for discovery + Mini Apps for gameplay)

1. Platform Analysis: Farcaster in 2025
1.1 Current State
Farcaster has approximately 710,000 total users and around 500,000 average casts per day as of late 2024. However, daily active users have declined by about 28% over the past six months.

What This Means for Riddlen:

Mature audience - Early crypto adopters, high purchasing power
Less viral than peak - Need strong product-market fit, not just hype
Quality over quantity - Engaged users more valuable than vanity metrics
Opportunity - Less competition as hype fades, serious builders remain
1.2 Frames Evolution
Frames v1 (January 2024):

Built on Open Graph protocol, allowing interactive experiences embedded in social feeds
Catalyzed 400% increase in daily active users in February 2024
Limited to image-based interactions with up to 4 buttons
Server-side rendering for every interaction
Frames v2 / Mini Apps (Early 2025):

Supports full-screen applications with interactive experiences, onchain transactions, and real-time notifications
Allows users to run full-fledged web apps directly in Warpcast using standard browser technology
Client-side interactivity reduces latency
Direct Ethereum wallet connectivity
Strategic Implication:
Build with Frames v1 for feed discovery, transition users to Mini Apps for full gameplay experience.

2. Technical Assessment: Frames.js
2.1 What is Frames.js?
Frames.js is a React-based TypeScript library and framework for writing and testing Farcaster Frames, including a built-in debugger.

Core Capabilities:

React/JSX syntax for familiar development
Built-in local debugger with live reloading
Next.js integration (ideal for Riddlen's stack)
TypeScript support for type safety
State management through context
Hot reloading, state management, and built-in wallet connection

3. Security & Best Practices
3.1 Critical Security Considerations
Apps should proxy image requests to prevent frame servers from tracking users, avoid rendering SVGs as they may contain executable code, and sanitize redirect URLs to ensure they start with http:// or https://.

Implementation for Riddlen:

1. Image Proxying

typescript
// Never serve images directly from user-provided URLs
// Use Next.js Image Optimization
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image 
  src={proxyImageUrl(userProvidedUrl)} 
  alt="Riddle NFT"
  width={1200}
  height={630}
/>
2. URL Sanitization

typescript
function sanitizeRedirect(url: string): string {
  const parsed = new URL(url);
  if (!['http:', 'https:'].includes(parsed.protocol)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid protocol');
  }
  // Whitelist your own domains
  if (!parsed.hostname.endsWith('riddlen.io')) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized domain');
  }
  return url;
}
3. Transaction Security

typescript
// Always validate wallet signatures
import { validateFrameMessage } from "frames.js/next";

const { isValid, message } = await validateFrameMessage(body);
if (!isValid) {
  return errorResponse('Invalid signature');
}

// Verify user owns the FID
const fid = message.requesterFid;
// Check against your database
3.2 Wallet Integration Best Practices
Farcaster Frames support integration with popular Web3 wallets like MetaMask or WalletConnect, allowing users to authenticate their identity and enable secure interactions with the decentralized network.

For Riddlen:

Auto-Detect Farcaster Wallet:

typescript
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'

// Get user's verified address
const context = await sdk.context;
const userAddress = context.user.verifiedAddresses[0];

// Use this for Polygon transactions
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  RIDDLEN_NFT_ADDRESS,
  abi,
  provider
);
Gas Sponsorship Strategy:

Sponsor first 3 riddle mints to reduce friction
Use Biconomy or Gelato for gas abstraction
Set spending limits per user to prevent abuse
Transaction Flow:

1. User clicks "Mint Riddle NFT"
2. Frame calls your API with user's FID
3. Your backend checks: first time user?
4. If yes ‚Üí sponsor gas, mint directly to their address
5. If no ‚Üí require wallet signature
6. Show success Frame with "Play Now" button
3.3 Data Privacy
What You Can Access:

User's Farcaster ID (FID)
Verified wallet addresses
Public profile data (username, bio, pfp)
Social graph (followers, following)
What You CANNOT Access:

Private messages
Unverified wallet balances
Personal information beyond public profile
GDPR Compliance:

All data is blockchain-based and pseudonymous
No PII collected through Frames
User controls their Farcaster ID and can delete it
Your responsibility: Don't link FIDs to off-chain PII
4. Implementation Guide
4.1 Setup Process
Step 1: Install Frames.js

bash
npm install frames.js
npm install @farcaster/frame-sdk
Step 2: Create Frame Handler

typescript
// app/frames/route.ts
import { createFrames } from "frames.js/next";

export const frames = createFrames({
  basePath: "/frames",
});

const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  const riddleId = ctx.searchParams.riddleId || "current";
  const riddle = await getRiddleData(riddleId);
  
  return {
    image: (
      <div style={{
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'column',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        backgroundColor: '#1a1a2e',
        color: 'white',
      }}>
        <h1>{riddle.name}</h1>
        <p>Prize Pool: {riddle.prizePool} RDLN</p>
        <p>Winners: {riddle.currentWinners}/{riddle.maxWinners}</p>
      </div>
    ),
    buttons: [
      <Button action="post" target="/mint">
        üéÆ Play Now ({riddle.mintCost} RDLN)
      </Button>,
      <Button action="link" target={`https://riddlen.io/riddle/${riddleId}`}>
        üìä Details
      </Button>,
    ],
  };
});

export const GET = handleRequest;
export const POST = handleRequest;
Step 3: Add to Your Page

typescript
// app/page.tsx
import { fetchMetadata } from "frames.js/next";

export async function generateMetadata() {
  return {
    title: "Riddlen - Solve to Earn",
    other: await fetchMetadata(
      new URL("/frames", process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL)
    ),
  };
}
4.2 Debugging Setup
Frames.js includes a debugger - running locally provides a URL you can paste into Warpcast frame validator with live preview and time-travel debugging.

Local Development:

bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000/frames/debug
Testing in Warpcast:

Go to https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames
Paste your localhost URL (use ngrok for HTTPS)
Click "Preview" to see your Frame
Test all button interactions
4.3 Riddlen-Specific Implementation
Frame 1: Active Riddle Display

typescript
// Purpose: Show in Farcaster feed to attract players

import { frames } from "./frames";
import { Button } from "frames.js/next";

const activeRiddleFrame = frames(async (ctx) => {
  const riddle = await getActiveRiddle();
  
  return {
    image: await generateRiddleImage(riddle),
    buttons: [
      <Button action="post" target="/mint">
        üéÆ Mint & Play ({riddle.mintCost} RDLN)
      </Button>,
      <Button action="link" target="/leaderboard">
        üèÜ Leaderboard
      </Button>,
      <Button action="link" target="/stats">
        üìä My Stats
      </Button>,
    ],
  };
});
Frame 2: Minting Flow

typescript
const mintFrame = frames(async (ctx) => {
  const { isValid, message } = await validateFrameMessage(ctx.request);
  
  if (!isValid) {
    return errorFrame("Invalid request");
  }
  
  const userFid = message.requesterFid;
  const userAddress = message.requesterVerifiedAddresses[0];
  
  // Check if user needs gas sponsorship
  const isFirstTime = await isFirstTimeUser(userFid);
  
  if (isFirstTime) {
    // Sponsor the mint
    await mintRiddleNFT(userAddress, riddleId, { gasless: true });
  } else {
    // Require user signature
    return {
      image: "Please approve transaction in your wallet",
      buttons: [
        <Button action="tx" target="/tx/mint" post_url="/success">
          Approve Mint
        </Button>
      ],
    };
  }
  
  return {
    image: "NFT Minted! Ready to play?",
    buttons: [
      <Button action="link" target={`https://riddlen.io/play/${riddleId}`}>
        üß† Solve Riddle
      </Button>
    ],
  };
});
Frame 3: Victory Share

typescript
// Auto-generated when user wins
const victoryFrame = frames(async (ctx) => {
  const { riddleId, winAmount, userName } = ctx.searchParams;
  
  return {
    image: (
      <div style={styles.victory}>
        <h1>üéâ {userName} won {winAmount} RDLN!</h1>
        <p>Riddle #{riddleId} conquered</p>
      </div>
    ),
    buttons: [
      <Button action="link" target={`https://riddlen.io/riddle/${riddleId}`}>
        üß© Try This Riddle
      </Button>,
      <Button action="link" target="https://riddlen.io">
        üß† Play Riddlen
      </Button>
    ],
  };
});
4.4 State Management
Context Pattern:

typescript
type RiddlenContext = {
  currentRiddle: Riddle;
  userStats: UserStats;
  activeWallet: string;
};

const handleRequest = frames(async (ctx) => {
  // Access previous state
  const previousState = ctx.state as RiddlenContext;
  
  // Update state
  return {
    image: ...,
    buttons: ...,
    state: {
      ...previousState,
      currentRiddle: await getNextRiddle(),
    }
  };
});
5. Mini Apps Integration (Frames v2)
5.1 When to Use Mini Apps vs Frames
Mini Apps allow full-fledged web applications with client-side interactivity, while Frames set clear guidelines where users know what to expect with image-based interactions.

Riddlen Strategy:

Use Frames (v1) For:

Initial discovery in feed
Quick riddle previews
Leaderboard snapshots
Victory sharing
Minting flow
Use Mini Apps (v2) For:

Actual riddle gameplay
Complex multi-step riddles
Real-time timer display
Question submission portal
User profile dashboard
5.2 Mini App Setup
Manifest File:

json
// .well-known/farcaster.json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    // Your verified Farcaster account
  },
  "miniapp": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Riddlen",
    "iconUrl": "https://riddlen.io/icon.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://riddlen.io/play",
    "imageUrl": "https://riddlen.io/og-image.png",
    "buttonTitle": "üß† Solve Riddles",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://riddlen.io/splash.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#1a1a2e",
    "webhookUrl": "https://riddlen.io/api/webhook"
  }
}
SDK Integration:

typescript
// app/play/page.tsx
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

export default function PlayRiddle() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Signal app is ready
    sdk.actions.ready();
    
    // Get user context
    const context = await sdk.context;
    console.log('User FID:', context.user.fid);
    console.log('Wallet:', context.user.verifiedAddresses[0]);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="riddle-game">
      {/* Your full riddle gameplay UI */}
    </div>
  );
}
Transition from Frame to Mini App:

typescript
// In your Frame
<Button 
  action="link" 
  target="https://riddlen.io/play?miniApp=true&riddleId=42"
>
  üéÆ Play Full Game
</Button>
6. Performance Optimization
6.1 Image Generation
Use Vercel OG for Dynamic Images:

typescript
import { ImageResponse } from '@vercel/og';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const riddle = await getRiddle(searchParams.get('id'));
  
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        display: 'flex',
        flexDirection: 'column',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        backgroundColor: '#1a1a2e',
      }}>
        <h1 style={{ fontSize: 60, color: 'white' }}>
          {riddle.name}
        </h1>
        <p style={{ fontSize: 40, color: '#a855f7' }}>
          {riddle.prizePool} RDLN
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1200,
      height: 630,
    }
  );
}
Performance Tips:

Cache generated images in CDN
Use WebP format when possible
Keep images under 500KB
Optimize font loading
6.2 Response Time
The main challenge in Frames is that every user action requires a server response, so designing for fast responses is critical to avoid clunky experiences.

Targets:

< 200ms - Excellent (user perceives instant)
< 500ms - Good (acceptable for most interactions)
< 1000ms - Poor (users notice lag)
> 1000ms - Unacceptable (users abandon)
Optimization Strategies:

1. Database Queries

typescript
// Bad: Multiple queries
const riddle = await db.riddle.findUnique({ where: { id } });
const winners = await db.winner.findMany({ where: { riddleId: id } });
const stats = await db.stats.get(riddleId);

// Good: Single query with includes
const riddle = await db.riddle.findUnique({
  where: { id },
  include: {
    winners: true,
    stats: true,
  },
});
2. Caching

typescript
import { unstable_cache } from 'next/cache';

const getActiveRiddle = unstable_cache(
  async () => {
    return await db.riddle.findFirst({
      where: { status: 'ACTIVE' },
      include: { winners: true },
    });
  },
  ['active-riddle'],
  { revalidate: 60 } // Cache for 60 seconds
);
3. Parallel Processing

typescript
// Bad: Sequential
const riddle = await getRiddle(id);
const user = await getUser(fid);
const leaderboard = await getLeaderboard();

// Good: Parallel
const [riddle, user, leaderboard] = await Promise.all([
  getRiddle(id),
  getUser(fid),
  getLeaderboard(),
]);
7. Growth & Distribution Strategy
7.1 Discoverability
Channel Strategy:

/riddlen - Create dedicated Farcaster channel
/polygon - Post in Polygon community channel
/web3games - Cross-promote with gaming community
/nft - Showcase riddle NFTs
Posting Cadence:

Daily: New riddle announcement with Frame
3x/week: Leaderboard updates
2x/week: Winner spotlights
1x/week: Community highlights
7.2 Viral Mechanics
Auto-Share on Win:

typescript
// When user completes riddle
const shareFrame = {
  image: victoryImage,
  buttons: [
    <Button action="link" target={`/riddle/${id}`}>
      Challenge Accepted! üß†
    </Button>
  ]
};

// Prompt user to cast
sdk.actions.openComposer({
  text: `Just won ${amount} RDLN solving @riddlen #${id}! Think you're smarter? üß©`,
  embeds: [shareFrameUrl],
});
Referral System:

typescript
// Track referrals via Frame state
const riddleFrame = frames(async (ctx) => {
  const referrer = ctx.searchParams.ref;
  
  if (referrer) {
    await trackReferral(referrer, ctx.message.requesterFid);
  }
  
  return {
    image: ...,
    buttons: [
      <Button action="link" target={`/play?ref=${ctx.message.requesterFid}`}>
        üéÅ Invite Friends (Earn 10%)
      </Button>
    ]
  };
});
7.3 Farcaster-Specific Features
Composer Actions: Allow users to share riddles directly from Warpcast composer.

Profile Display: Show RON score and riddles solved in user's Farcaster bio.

Notifications: Send push notifications when:

New riddle launches
User is outscored on leaderboard
Friend completes a riddle
Reward claim available
8. Monetization & Economics
8.1 Revenue Streams
1. NFT Minting Fees

Current: 1,000 RDLN per mint (years 1-2)
Halves every 2 years
Projected revenue: 19.97M RDLN over 20 years
2. Burn Protocol Revenue

Failed attempts burn RDLN
Accumulated: ~650K RDLN over lifecycle
3. Oracle Network (Future)

Enterprise clients pay RDLN for validation
Validators earn from their RON reputation
Platform takes 10-20% commission
4. Secondary NFT Royalties

10% royalty on riddle NFT resales
Trading volume depends on collectibility
8.2 Farcaster-Specific Costs
Fixed Costs:

Farcaster account: $5 one-time (or free with US phone)
Custom domain: $10-50/year
Hosting: $20-100/month (Vercel Pro)
Variable Costs:

Image generation: Vercel OG (free tier sufficient)
API calls: Negligible
Gas sponsorship: 0.001-0.01 ETH per mint (~$2-20)
Break-Even Analysis:

Sponsor 100 users @ $5 each = $500
Need 500 mints @ 1,000 RDLN each
At $0.01 per RDLN = $5,000 revenue
ROI: 10x after 500 users
