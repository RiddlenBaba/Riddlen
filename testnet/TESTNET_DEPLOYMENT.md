## **🎯 Core Innovation: Tiered Reward System**

**Revolutionary player incentives that prevent NFT hoarding:**

```
Example: 20 Winners Total
├── Tier 1 (Positions 1-5):   2.0x rewards → ~88,888 RDLN each
├── Tier 2 (Positions 6-15):  1.0x rewards → ~44,444 RDLN each
└── Tier 3 (Positions 16-20): 0.5x rewards → ~22,222 RDLN each

Total Distribution: 1,000,000 RDLN prize pool
Incentive Ratio: First solver gets 4x more than last solver
```

**Result**: Players rush to solve quickly instead of sitting on NFTs!

## **🛡️ Rug-Proof Treasury System**

**Unbreakable holder protections built into smart contracts:**

### **Immutable Constants (Cannot be changed by anyone)**
```solidity
MONTHLY_OPERATIONS_RELEASE = 1,000,000 RDLN  // Fixed monthly releases
RELEASE_INTERVAL = 30 days                   // Fixed schedule
MAX_EMERGENCY_RELEASE = 5,000,000 RDLN      // Max emergency per year
EMERGENCY_COOLDOWN = 365 days               // 1 year between emergencies
```

### **What Holders Can Trust**
- ✅ **Predictable supply**: Maximum 12M RDLN per year from operations
- ✅ **Emergency transparency**: Max 5M with detailed reasoning
- ✅ **No surprise dumps**: All releases are time-locked and limited
- ✅ **Full transparency**: Real-time tracking via `getSupplyProtectionInfo()`

## **🔄 Player Progression System**

### **Access Tiers**
1. **EASY Riddles**: Open to everyone (entry point)
2. **MEDIUM Riddles**: Requires SOLVER tier RON (earned from EASY)
3. **HARD Riddles**: Requires EXPERT tier RON (advanced players)
4. **ORACLE Riddles**: Requires ORACLE tier RON (governance elite)

### **Progression Flow**
```
New Player → EASY Riddles → Earn RON → SOLVER Tier → MEDIUM Riddles
     ↓
Advanced Player → EXPERT Tier → HARD Riddles → ORACLE Tier → Governance
```

## **🧪 Testing Instructions**

### **For Frontend Integration**
```javascript
// Contract ABIs and addresses
const RDLN_ADDRESS = "0x133029184EC460F661d05b0dC57BFC916b4AB0eB"
const RON_ADDRESS = "0xD86b146Ed091b59cE050B9d40f8e2760f14Ab635"
const RIDDLE_NFT_ADDRESS = "0x529e3076cB9A48D6FAd086abE5d23ea76159e9E3"

// Test the tiered reward system
await riddleNFT.previewTieredReward(prizePool, totalWinners, solvePosition)

// Check user's access tier
const userTier = await ron.getUserTier(userAddress)

// Execute monthly treasury release (anyone can call)
if (await rdln.canExecuteMonthlyRelease()) {
    await rdln.executeMonthlyOperationsRelease()
}
```

### **Complete User Journey Test**
1. **Start**: User gets RDLN tokens
2. **Entry**: Mint EASY difficulty riddle NFT
3. **Solve**: Submit answer and earn RON + tiered RDLN rewards
4. **Progress**: Use RON to access MEDIUM/HARD riddles
5. **Governance**: Participate in DAO with ORACLE tier
